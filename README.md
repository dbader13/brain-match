# brain-match
Match two Connectome brain graphs.

This contains several helper programs as well:

**transform-connectome-graph**: Convert the VNC Connectome male and female graphs into generic graphs \
**transform-solution**: Convert a solution matching into a VNC Connectome male and female solution file \
**score-matching**: Find the score of a matching between two graphs \
**identity-match**: Given one graph, create a matching (i,i) for each vertex \
**spectral-match**: Given two graphs, use spectral methods to find a matching \
**refine-match-hillclimb**: Given two graphs and matching, use hill-climbing to improve the match
